## üé• App Walkthrough

> **Note:** Due to technical limitations in the FIU library (outdated iMacs, no ability to install screen recording software, and 95% simulator failure rates), I was unable to record a traditional walkthrough video.  
>  
> Instead, I have uploaded a GIF demo of the core features to demonstrate the app‚Äôs functionality.

## üìù Notes

- The biggest challenge was working with the API response format and ensuring fallback behavior on failure.
- I originally planned to add multi-language support and Firebase integration, but prioritized stability of the base features due to limited hardware access and development time.
